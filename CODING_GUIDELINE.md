CODING GUIDELINE
-------------------

Fork the project, create a feature branch, and send us a pull request.
Preferably on a distinct branch.

To ensure a consistent code base, you should make sure the code follows
the [PSR-12: Extended Coding Style](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) and the [Symfony Coding Standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html). You can also
run [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) with the
configuration file that can be found in the project root directory.
